# Installation

Origin.js is used on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). It is possible to complete installation and setup through these methods.

## Download directly

Import `originjs` in `<script>` and it will be installed automatically:

```html
<script src="/path/to/originjs.js"></script>
```

## NPM

```bash
npm install @originjs/origin.js --save
```

## Yarn

```bash
yarn add @originjs/origin.js
```

## Dev build

You need to clone `origin.js` directly from `GitHub` and build it yourself, if you want to use the latest dev build.

```bash
# clone from github
git clone https://github.com/originjs/origin.js.git node_modules/origin.js
# change directory
cd node_modules/origin.js
# install dependencies
npm install
# build
npm run build
```
